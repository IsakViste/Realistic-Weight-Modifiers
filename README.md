## <a name="information"></a>Information
Realistic Weight Modifiers is a minecraft 1.10.2 mod, giving items a weight value that will affect player movement speed making to give a more RPG-like feel.
Items in inventory have a customisable weight value that will increase the players current weight, and if this weight passes a certain value, the player will move slower related to the excess weight.
The mod allows the player to decide whether a stack should count as 1 item when adding weight, or if each item of the stack should increase the weight.
It also lets the player choose the amount of weight the player can wear/hold before starting to get encumbered, and the rate at which the players movement speed gets slower.
